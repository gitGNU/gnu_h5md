Changes in the H5MD file format
-------------------------------

### Changes in H5MD 1.1

1. The development process for H5MD is based on proposals

	Proposals are motivated and present a change to the file format in detail. A
	change should be accompanied by sample code to test the viability of an
	idea. This change is formalised in proposal 1.

2. Proposal 100: Storage of time information

	Several changes are made: The `time` dataset can be left out if it is not
    needed. The `step` and `time` datasets can be scalar, in which case the data
    is mandatorily sampled at equal time intervals.

3. Proposal 101: Particles and tuples lists

	A storage layout is defined for lists of particles and lists of tuples of
    particles.

4. Proposal 102: Storage of charges

	Charges can be stored in a `particles` group along other per-particle data.

5. proposal 103: Connectivity group

	The storage layout defined in proposal 101 is used to unify the storage of
    connectivity information, i.e. lists of pairs (or bonds), etc.
