Specifications for the h5md file format
========================================

Objective
---------

h5md is aimed at becoming a specification to store molecular simulation data.
It is based on the `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ file format. h5md
stands for "hdf5 for molecular data".

It should facilitate portability of said data amongst simulation and analysis
programs.

General organization
--------------------

h5md defines a HDF5 group structure. Inside a group, a number of required
fields exist and should possess a conforming name and shape.

Several groups may exist in a file, allowing the description of several
subsystems. Multiple time steps are found inside a single dataset. One can then
obtain either a snapshot of the system at a given time or extract a single
trajectory via dataset slicing.

The file is allowed to possess non-conforming groups that contain other
information such as simulation parameters.

Global attributes
-----------------

A few global attributes are defined for convenience. They should set for the
file. 

* creator: The name of the program that created the file.
* h5md_version: The version of the h5md specification that the file conforms to.

Optional global attributes:

* datetime: date and time of creation.

Standardized data elements
--------------------------

Trajectory group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* atomic coordinates in 1,2 or 3D

  The coordinates are stored in the dataset named "position". The dataset has the
  dimensions \[variable\]\[N\]\[D\] where the variable dimension is present to
  accumulate timesteps.

* atomic velocities in 1,2 or 3D

  As for the coordinates in a dataset named "velocity"
  
* atomic forces in 1,2 or 3D

  As for the coordinates in a dataset named "force"
  
* species
  
  A dataset of dimensions \[N\] if the species do not change in the course of
  time, that is if there is no chemical reaction occurring, or of dimensions
  \[variable\]\[N\] if the species of particles may change in the course of
  time. The species are stored as 1-byte unsigned integers.

All arrays are stored in C-order as enforced by the HDF5 file format (see `ยง
3.2.5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/UG/12_Dataspaces.html#ProgModel>`_). A C
or C++ program may thus declare r\[N\]\[D\] for the coordinates array while the
fortran program will declaire a r(D,N) array (appropriate index ordering for a
N atoms D dimensions system) and the hdf5 file will be the same.

The "position", "velocity" and "force" datasets possess an attribute that is a
link to the time indices (the integer number of steps up to that point in the
simulation) and a link to the time (time in physical units).

The "position", "velocity" and "force" datasets possess an optional attribute
that is the unit of their respective data ("nm" for the position, for instance).

Trajectory subgroups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some simulations effectively take into account different kind of particles. For
example, a solvent (with a large number of particles) may only be needed for
checkpointing only.
In this situation, the 'trajectory' group will contain *only* subgroups. Each of
these subgroups are then considered trajectory groups in themselves.

Storage of the time information in the trajectory group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To link data from the trajectory group datasets to a time in the simulation, two
datasets containing the integer time step (number of simulation steps) and the
physical time (the time in simulational or physical units, real-valued) are
necessary. If all data are dump at similar times, in which case "step" is a
dataset of dimension \[variable\] of type integer and "time" is a dataset of
dimension \[variable\] and of type real. If data are sampled at different times
(for instance, one needs the positions more frequently than the velocities),
"step" and "time" are groups in which datasets with the same names as the
trajectory datasets are found and contain the relevant data.

In order to read the information, the procedure is similar in both cases: the
trajectory datasets contain the attributes "step" and "time" that link to the
appropriate dataset.


Observables group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Macroscopic observables are stored as one-dimensional time series. Their length
is variable to accumulate time-steps. The name of the group holding these
datasets is "observables".

* total_energy
* interaction_energy
* kinetic_energy
* temperature

Program-dependent groups
------------------------

Some informations do not adequately fit a strict specification and can be
included in groups whose name is however specified. These names are listed here.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

The "parameters" group may contain all parameters passed to initialize the
simulation. Example are: temperature, random number generator seed, ...

Profiling
^^^^^^^^^

The "profiling" group may contain information related to the timing of various
parts of the simulation.

Reserved names
--------------

Part of the h5md specification is a number of reserved names. This allows a data
analysis package to handle adequately the datasets with reserved names. Future
names should be kept concise but worded fully.

The present list of reserved names is:

* position
* velocity
* force
* total_energy
* interaction_energy
* kinetic_energy
* temperature
* creator
* h5md_version
* datetime
* parameters
* profiling
* observables

Data elements in discussion
---------------------------

* Reserved names

  At this time, position, velocity and force are reserved. How far should we
  specify? Other elements seem appropriate for reserved names: temperature, time
  step - DT, ...

* Simulation box information

  Some information on the simulation box geometry could be included. As a minimal suggestion: box_origin = basis point in the D dimensions (lowest value reached by the position) , box_size (total linear size in each dimension)

* Topology

  There is the need to store topology for rigid bodies, elastic networks or
  proteins. The topology may be a connectivity table, contain bond lengths, ...

* Macroscopic variables

  These are variables that are computed during a simulation.

* Simulation parameters

  Box size, time step, used force field, per species mass, ...

* Scalar and vector fields

  May be used to store coarse grained or cell-based physical quantities.

* Species information

  Some simulations allow species to change in time via chemical reactions. The
  species thus need their own time-dependent dataset. To simplify matters, it is
  suggested to use a \[variable\]\[N\] dataset for such simulations but only a
  \[N\] dataset when the species are fixed in the course of time. Species may be
  specified by a 1-byte integer (8-bit, allowing 256 values).

* Parallel issues

  Altough not a specification in itself, one advantage of using HDF5 is the
  Parallel-HDF5 extension for MPI environments. File written by parallel
  programs should be identical to programs written by serial programs.

  An issue remains however: as particles move in space, they may belong to
  varying CPUs. A proposition to this problem is to send all particles, as a
  copy, to their original CPU and to write them from there using collective IO
  calls. Particles for which the ordering is not important (for instance solvent
  particles that may be required for checkpointing only) could be written from
  their actual CPU without recreating the original order.
