H5MD - proposal 102: Storage of charges
---------------------------------------

**status:** draft

### Objective

This proposal aims at defining the storage of per-particle charge data.

### Motivations

Charge data is missing from H5MD 1.0. It is, at the very least, useful for
atomic-level simulations. The interpretation of the value depends however on the
situation.

See the original request and the subsequent discussion
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.simulation.h5md.user/685

This proposal does not list explicitly all use cases but clarifies the most
common interpretations.

### Data in particles group

`charge`
:   An element that contains the charge for each particle as a scalar, of
    `Integer` or `Float` type.
    
    `charge` has the optional attribute `type` of fixed-length string datatype
    and of scalar dataspace whose value is `effective` or `real`.
    In the case `effective`, the charge is considered part of an effective
    description of the system as is requested for empirical force-fields or
    coarse-grained models.
    In the case `real`, the charge is the so-called "formal charge" on an atom
    (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_charge>) and must of the
    `Integer` type.
    This corresponds to the entries in PDB files (see definition in the
    DBx/mmCIF dictionary
    <http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/dictionaries/mmcif_pdbx_v40.dic/Items/_atom_site.pdbx_formal_charge.html>).
