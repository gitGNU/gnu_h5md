H5MD - proposal 1: H5MD proposals
---------------------------------

**status:** draft

### Objective

H5MD proposals represent a way to discuss modifications of improvements to H5MD.

### Motivations

The development of H5MD relies on discussions on the mailing list. This presents
a few shortcomings, notably the absence of a comprehensive source of information
on any given topic.

### Guidelines

H5MD proposals consist of [markdown] formatted files.
The status (draft, implemented, rejected) must be indicated.
Regular H5MD proposals are numbered sequentially, starting at 100.
H5MD proposals below 100 concern the development process of H5MD.
