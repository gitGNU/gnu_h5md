H5MD - proposal 1: H5MD proposals
---------------------------------

**status:** draft

### Introduction

H5MD proposals represent a way to discuss modifications of improvements to H5MD.
They are directly inspired by the [Python Enhancement Proposals].

The development of H5MD relies on discussions on the mailing list. This presents
a few shortcomings, notably the absence of a comprehensive source of information
on any given topic.
Starting from the released 1.0.0 specification, significant changes to H5MD will
be based on H5MD proposals.

### Guidelines

Formatting and numbering:

- H5MD proposals consist of [markdown] formatted files.
- The status (draft, implemented, rejected) must be indicated.
- Regular H5MD proposals are numbered sequentially, starting at 100.
  H5MD proposals below 100 concern the development process of H5MD.

Content:

- A H5MD proposal must propose an explicit change to the H5MD specification,
  along with background information.
- H5MD proposals that change the content of a H5MD file must consider the
  technical specificities of HDF5.
