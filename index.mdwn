H5MD : HDF5 for molecular data
==============================

[H5MD] is a file format specification, based upon [HDF5], aimed at the
efficient and portable storage of molecular data (e.g. simulation
trajectories, molecular structures, …). H5MD implements data models for
a variety of computational problems, e.g., molecular simulation using
molecular dynamics, or computational fluid dynamics using multi-particle
collision dynamics.

The first official release of the specification, H5MD 1.1.0, contains particle
trajectories (positions, velocities, forces and species) as well as
thermodynamical observables. In the future, extensions will be considered
on the basis of discussion with users of H5MD.

The development of H5MD was started by Pierre de Buyl, Peter Colberg and Felix
Höfling. H5MD now includes contributions by other developers. H5MD is available
under the [GNU General Public License] version 3, or any later version.
H5MD is presented in P. de Buyl, P. H. Colberg and F. Höfling,
