Thermodynamic observables
-------------------------

### Objective

This module defines a set of thermodynamic observables commonly output by
molecular simulation programs.


### Module name and version

The name of this module is `thermodynamics`. The module version is 1.0.0.


### Observables

For each subsystem stored in the `particles` group as `/particles/<group>`, the
`observables` group shall contain a corresponding group `/observables/<group>`
with one or more of the following *elements*:

`dimension`
  : The dimension of the space embedding the subsystem.

`particles`
  : The number of particles of the subsystem.

`volume`
  : The volume of the subsystem.

`pressure`
  : The pressure of the subsystem.

`temperature`
  : The instantaneous temperature of the subsystem as inferred from the kinetic
    energy.

`potential_energy`
  : The potential energy of the subsystem.

`kinetic_energy`
  : The kinetic energy of the subsystem.

`internal_energy`
  : The internal energy of the subsystem, typically the sum of potential and
    kinetic energy.

`enthalpy`
  : The enthalpy of the subsystem.

The latter 4 elements are stored as extensive quantities (proportional to the
number of particles). The corresponding intensive quantities are obtained by
normalization, e.g., with the number of particles or the volume.
