Thermodynamic observables
-------------------------

### Objective

This module defines a set of thermodynamic observables commonly output by
molecular simulation programs.


### Module name and version

The name of this module is `thermodynamics`. The module version is `1`.


### Observables

For each subsystem stored in the `particles` group as `/particles/<group>`, the
`observables` group shall contain a corresponding group `/observables/<group>`
with one or more of the following *elements*:

`dimension`
  : The dimensionality of the coordinates of the subsystem.

`particles`
  : The number of particles of the subsystem.

`temperature`
  : The instantaneous temperature of the subsystem.

`pressure`
  : The pressure of the subsystem.

`potential_energy`
  : The potential energy of the subsystem.

`average_potential_energy`
  : The potential energy of the subsystem, as an average per particle.

`kinetic_energy`
  : The kinetic energy of the subsystem.

`average_kinetic_energy`
  : The kinetic energy of the subsystem, as an average per particle.

`total_energy`
  : The total energy of the subsystem.

`average_total_energy`
  : The total energy of the subsystem, as an average per particle.
