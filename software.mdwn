Free/Libre software for H5MD files
==================================

This is a list of [free
software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) for use with H5MD
files.

Reading and writing H5MD files
------------------------------

The [HDF5 library](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) provides interfaces
for C, Fortran, C++, and Java.

[HDF5 for Python](http://www.h5py.org/) by Andrew Collette provides a
Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format.

[f90h5md](http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~pdebuyl/code/f90h5md.html) by
Pierre de Buyl is a Fortran 90 implementation of H5MD.

[pyh5md](https://github.com/pdebuyl/pyh5md) by Pierre de Buyl is a
Python module that facilitate reading and writing H5MD files.

Simulation
----------

[HAL's MD package](http://halmd.org/) by Felix Höfling and Nicolas Höft
is a high-precision molecular dynamics package for the large-scale
simulation of simple and complex liquids.

Analysis and plotting
---------------------

[h5md-tools](https://github.com/fhoefling/h5md-tools) by Felix Höfling
is a tool set for analysing, plotting, and manipulating data of
molecular simulations stored in the H5MD file format.

[VMD-h5mdplugin](https://github.com/jonaslandsgesell/VMD-h5mdplugin.git),
an H5MD file reader plugin for VMD, is being developed by Olaf Lenz,
Sascha Ehrhardt and Jonas Landsgesell.

[VOTCA](http://www.votca.org/) is an analysis package for molecular dynamics
data that focuses on systematic coarse-graining and microscopic charge transport.
